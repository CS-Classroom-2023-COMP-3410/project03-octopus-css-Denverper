**Project 3 Reflection - Denver Persinger**

In this project, I aimed to use as little inline CSS as possible, only using it when neccesary or when using the external file is impractical. Therefore, a majority of my CSS that makes the webpage look like the screenshot is in my styles.css file. I did not find this project too dificult, but it was interesting to see the page evolve with ever edit! An interesting realization was how bad ChatGPT was at reproducing pure CSS to acheive a given look, even when given all of the HTML and the reference image. It was helpful in generating the beginnings of the neccesary CSS, but most of the result is due to hand curated styling over trial and error.

The most challenging aspect of this project was in the quiz section, where the image had to be below the text in a column format, while it is written in the HTML code above it. Since there were three items in that block, the title, the image, and the form. I was very confused on how to style the image and header. In order to solve this issue I stopped by office hours and was given advice to change the position of the image to absolute and manually change the position within the quiz section block. This helped solve the problem, and after moving the elements around with `top` and `left` tags, I was able to acheive the desired look, and I am very happy with the overall product in terms of similarity with the provided image!
